# Sims 4 Toolkit - Models (@s4tk/models)

## Overview

This project contains the models, enums, and other structures required for reading and writing Sims 4 package files and the resources they contain.

**PLEASE NOTE**: Proper documentation for this package will be provided when the Sims 4 Toolkit website has been completed. Please be patient, because this will take a little while to finish. For now, reference this README's Documentation section for a basic introduction, and feel free to browse the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/sims4toolkit/models.git) as needed. Every class, type, and function has thorough documentation available in the comments, and this should be enough to understand how the library works for now.

## Installation
